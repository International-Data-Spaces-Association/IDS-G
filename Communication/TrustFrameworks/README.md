# Trust Frameworks #

## Introduction ##

The Trust Framework for IDS is described in the [IDS-RAM Security Perspective](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-ram-4/perspectives-of-the-reference-architecture-model/4_perspectives/4_1_security_perspective).

It focusses on:

- Identity and Trust Management
- Securing the platform (out of scope for Communication)
- Securing Applications (out of scope for Communication)
- Securing interaction between connectors

The Trust Framework is not part of the communication guide, but part of the IDSA Rulebook and IDS-RAM. (plus some sentences)
