# Registration #

## Introduction ##

You register a participant and the participant registers their agents.

Catalog function is out of scope here, so you get basic information about the participant, and you can validate if it is a participant.


particpant contains a list of valid agents (or at least to them).

The participant maintaines the agents it has/provides.
