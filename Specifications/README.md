# Getting Started

The [Information Model document](./model/information.model.md) defines the core concepts, entities, and relationships that underpin a `Dataspace`. 

The [Catalog Protocol document](./catalog/catalog.protocol.md) defines a how a `Catalog` is requested from a catalog service by a consumer using an abstract message exchange format.

The [Catalog Binding document](./catalog/catalog.binding.https.md) defines a RESTful API over HTTPS for the `Catalog Protocol`.

The [Bibliography](./notes/bibliography.md) contains links to relevant standards referenced by the above documents. 

Note that PlantUML diagrams will be replaced by Draw-IO alternatives.
