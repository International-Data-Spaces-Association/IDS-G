# Certificate Authority (CA)

One or multiple CAs issue identity certificates for connector instances by signing Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) that have been handed in by valid connector instances. They revoke certificates that become invalid. For higher trust levels, they will assure that private keys are properly stored in hardware modules (such as a TPM or HSM). They are essential trust building entities responsible for ensuring that only registered organizations may operate components in the IDS.
