| B 082 | An IDS Meta Data Broker may be able to negotiate or at least provide data exchange agreements, as long it has the legal rights to do so. |
| B 083 (B23) | An IDS Meta Data Broker may filter or prohibit access to indexed metadata if an IDS Meta Data Broker has indications that the respective Data Sovereign has an interest in doing so. Such an interest can be encoded through IDS Usage Control Contracts, limiting access also of metadata to certain constraints. |
| B 084 | An IDS Meta Data Broker may implement Usage Control engines, which can interpret and enforce IDS Usage Contracts as specified by the IDS Information Model. |
| B 085 | An IDS Meta Data Broker may indicate that a certain rule or contract inhibits access or pretend that the requested information does not exist. |
