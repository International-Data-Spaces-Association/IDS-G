# HTTP API
At this moment, the IDS Meta Data Broker Interface of the reference Implementation consists of at least two HTTP endpoints. One for query operations and the other for data manipulating requests. All input and output of the Broker API is in multipart format with three parts: Meta Data, Broker Message, and Signature.<p>
The API description in OpenAPI 3.0 is publicly available and has the same normative meaning as all other requirements of this document as far as the HTTP binding is concerned. The currently valid version of the API description is too large for this document but can be found at this link:<p>

A POSTMAN collection further describes exemplary client-side requests against an IDS Meta Data Broker following the above HTTP API. In contrast to the OpenAPI description of the API, the POSTMAN collection is a non-normative resource supporting the interested reader. It is hosted at this link:<p>
