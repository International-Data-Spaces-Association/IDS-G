# IDS Participant Information Service (ParIS)

## Necessity of the ParIS

One of the most important value propositions of the IDS is the enablement of business interactions between previously unrelated Participants. That aims in particular at companies that have not met before in the digital or non-digital world but now start business agreements solely relying on the IDS. The therefore necessary trust in the opposite party is technically achieved by a verifiable identity management process through the Identity Provisioning Service and the DAPS. Both components equip each Participant with the necessary attributes and cryptographic proofs for the IDS handshakes.
The establishment of a secure and uncompromised communication channel is however only the necessary requirement for a business interaction. In addition, the respective Participants need to understand their opposite’s state in regards of business workflows. For instance, every business actor needs to know its customers tax identification or VAT number to create correct invoices. Furthermore, the registered address is critical to understand the responsible jurisdiction for the unfortunate cases when only courts can solve conflicts.

## Business Workflow
Such information is provided and maintained by the Support Organization in an IDS, the legal entity that administers the ecosystem. The Support Organization introduces a new Participant by creating its digital identity and at the same time registers security-critical at the DAPS and business-relevant attributes at another technical component. This component is the Participant Information Service (ParIS). The ParIS provides access to these attributes to the other IDS Participants and components and connects the unique Participant identifier – a URI – with additional metadata. Usually, each IDS ecosystem operates only a small number of ParIS instances, usually only one. IDS Participants therefore know the location where to ask for more information about a potential business partner and can decide whether to start a data exchange.


# Participant Governance

Different to other IDS components, the trustworthiness of ParIS’ provisioned information is not grounded on technical measures, like for instance signatures or certificates, but on the administrative process controlled by the Support Organization. A direct consequence of this process is the necessity that each change request is manually verified before added to the ParIS database.


# Technical Workflow and IDS interactions

The initial population of a Participant entry is conducted directly after the certification and identity creation process is finished. The Support Organization is informed about the successful steps and provided with the corresponding metadata about the new entity (cf. Tab. 1). The provisioning of this information is not part of the IDS interactions yet and must be managed through traditional communication measures. The Support Organization verifies the correctness of the claims, verifies the information, and – together with other additional steps – equips the dedicated ParIS with the new IDS Participant instance. It is further recommended that each Participant also hosts this self-description on a publicly accessible HTTP server of its choice. Preferably the locator of this self-description document, a HTTP URL, is identical with the used Participant URI. This best practice enables the lookup or dereferencing of the Participant Identifier through every HTTP client and thereby eases the discovery of relevant information. Nevertheless, in case the own supplied Participant self-description and the metadata at the ParIS deviate, the latter is more trusted as its claims have been verified through the Support Organization beforehand.
Requests to the ParIS itself follow the IDS Message Model and are described, among others, in the IDS Communication Guide and the IDS Information Model. The most common call, the request for a description of an identified IDS Participant, is executed using the ids:DescriptionRequestMessage with the Participant Identifier at the ids:requestedElement attribute. The response message contains a JSON-LD representation of the Participant instance or returns an error message in case the requested identifier is not known to the server.


## Data Model, Participant and Participant Attributes
The attributes provided by the ParIS are in general not critical for the security aspects of the IDS but highly relevant for every business interaction. While for instance IDS handshakes can be executed without knowing the physical location of the opposite party, business processes need to know about the respective country and tax regulations, or which is the complete, legally valid name to create a proper invoice. Table 1 contains the currently defined properties of an IDS Participant that can be used to model the metadata for a ParIS. The described properties represent the minimal set of attributes each ParIS implementation must accept. Nevertheless, specialized implementations may also accept and provide additional properties, dependent on the domain-specific requirements or its technical capabilities.

| [ids:memberParticipant](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/memberParticipant)	|	[ids:Participant](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/Participant)	|	Indicates that a participant has a member which is again a participant. This is useful for defining hierarchical relations in a participant's organization as well as identifying groups of participants to capture, e.g., members of a collaboration.	|
| [ids:participantRefinement](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/participantRefinement)	|	[ids:AbstractConstraint](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/AbstractConstraint)	|	Conditions which needs to be satisfied that a single Participant can be seen as a member of the subject Participant. For instance, all Participants with their headquarter in Europe might be a potential consumer of GDPR-releated data.	|
| [ids:memberPerson](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/memberPerson)	|	[ids:Person](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/Person)	|	Indicates membership of a person to an organization.	|
| [ids:participantCertification](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/participantCertification)	| [ids:ParticipantCertification](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/ParticipantCertification) | 	Certification issued for the given Participant.
| [ids:primarySite](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/primarySite)	|	[ids:Site](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/Site)	|	Indicates a primary site for the Organization, this is the default means by which an Organization can be contacted and is not necessarily the formal headquarters.	|

| [gr:taxID](http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#taxID)	| [xsd:string](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string)	|	The Tax / Fiscal ID of the IDS Participant, e.g. the TIN in the US or the CIF/NIF in Spain. It is usually assigned by the country of residence.	|
| [ids:registryCourt](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/registryCourt)	| [xsd:string](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string)	|	The responsible court for the organization. Usually a city and country.	|

| [ids:hasRole](https://w3id.org/idsa/core/hasRole)	|	[xsd:anyURI](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#anyURI)	|	The internal organizational roles that the Participant wants to announce to business partners in order to restrict data usage. For instance, if the organization has dedicated “risk managers”, Data Providers can state that only users with this role can see the IDS Resource. A role must be encoded with a valid, unambiguous URI, for instance https://<company-domain/role#<role-name>.	|

## Future Developments

The IDS ParIS is an infrastructure component in the IDS general architecture with a similar functionality as the IDS Metadata Broker. While the latter indexes Data Resources and Connectors, the ParIS makes Participant information available. Further extensions of its specification may include a more fine-grained access and update model. That can contain the ability for each Participant to update non-critical attributes of its own description, for instance the corporate email address or the member persons. Other attributes, like for instance the VAT number or the legal name, will still require a verification process through the Support Organization. Realizing such options will enable a faster and more accurate provisioning of descriptive metadata while the trust level for critical attributes stays the same. The IDSA Working Group Architecture structures these activities and prepares the further development of the ParIS specification.
